    <p align="justify">A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team. <br>
        I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student. I joined 
        Tap Academy as a CSR student in the month of February. My journey 
        with Tap Academy is quite different. The trainers at Tap Academy are 
        skilled and experienced. They teach a lot of new concepts and help in 
        learning programming languages from scratch.
    <p align="justify">
        I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at Tap
        Academy is structured in a way that makes it easy for students from all 
        domains to understand the concepts and technology taught by the  trainers.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a package 
        of 3.25 LPA. The placement team helped me a lot in securing this job. 
    </p>
    <p align="justify"> Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping me acquire this  
        opportunity.</p>

    <p align="justify">After joining Tap Academy, I have improved my programming skills, and 
        my knowledge of core Java has also improved. Now, I am learning the 
        Collection Framework, MySQL, HTML, and CSS in parallel.
    <p align="justify">
        Through the TAI platform, I have enhanced my problem-solving skills. 
        Additionally, the LMS makes it easy to watch all the recorded videos. 
        They also provide recorded videos of frameworks like J2EE, Spring, 
        Data Structures, etc.

        I got placed in Promantia Business Solutions for the role of

    <p align="justify">
        I'm a student from the Feb 2 batch, and I'm happy to share my experience 
        with Tap Academy. They visited our college in Tamil Nadu and selected students 
        for their CSR batch, offering a free course that's been incredibly helpful. </p>
    <p align="justify">
        Compared to other academies, Tap Academy stands out for its excellent trainers,
         who explain complex concepts in a clear and concise manner, start from scratch,
         making it easy for beginners to understand, and provide in-depth coverage of 
         programming and OOPS concepts, highly valuable for placement opportunities. I'm 
         grateful to have been selected by Avasoft with the role of Trainee Engineer with
         a package of 5 LPA through college placement, and I attribute my success to Tap 
         Academy's incredible teaching, as I used the same approach they taught me during
         them mock interview process.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">Additionally, Tap Academy offers comprehensive notebooks and study materials, an 
        LMS platform with daily class recordings, a TAl platform for practicing daily programming 
        questions, weekly assessments, and monthly mock assessments and Interviews, boosting 
        placement confidence, as well as soft skill classes focusing on logical thinking.
